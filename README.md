bigextract
==========

Bigextract runs through CRYO's Big fileformat used in games such as ZeroZone and extracts audiosamples based on broken heuristics.

This blob of code was written somewhere in 2004, when I just started coding C, it's a clusterfuck of bad ways to do thing, but I decided to host it for sentimental reasons. Yes I know the brunt of the code is in the header file. Yes I know this is wrong :)

Alternatively, you can search the web for a program called GAP (Game Media Player) developed by ANX Software. This tool runs on Windows, but has no problems performing the task I originally set out to accomplish with this project.
