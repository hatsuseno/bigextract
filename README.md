Bigextract runs through CRYO's Big fileformat used in games such as ZeroZone and extracts audiosamples based on broken heuristics.

This blob of code was written somewhere in 2004, when I just started coding C, it's a clusterfuck of bad ways to do thing, but I decided to host it for sentimental reasons. Yes I know the brunt of the code is in the header file. Yes I know this is wrong :)
